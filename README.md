# AI-Assisted Coding

In [this chapter](https://neuraldatascience.io/3b-ai_assisted/introduction.html) we introduce GitHub Copilot, an AI-assisted programming tool that can help you write code. We will revisit some of the fundamental coding concepts that we introduced in the previous chapter, but this time we will use GitHub Copilot to help us write the code. As you will see, this is not always as strightforwad and magical as you might hope. AI-generated code might contain bugs, and it is important to understand how to debug code that you did not write yourself.

## Codespaces

To work in a codespace, click on the green **<> Code** button at the top right of this repositoryâ€™s GitHub page. Then click on the green button that says **Create codespace on main** to launch your codespace.
